The Helmholtz equation is an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) and represents a time-independent form of the wave equation.
It is named after German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) and has many applications in physics, including acoustics, seismology, and electromagnetic radiation.
The lightning method for solving PDEs with exceptional speed and accuracy has accomplished remarkable success with its original introduction for solving the Laplace equation, which has a state-of-the-art implementation that solves typical problems in less than 1 second on a desktop to 8-digit accuracy [[1]](#1).
This repository contains `helmholtz.m`, an implementation of the lightning method for solving the Helmholtz equation, carried out during my thesis entitled *Lightning Helmholtz solver*.
I completed this under the supervision of Professor Nick Trefethen as part of the MSc in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Oxford.

`helmholtz.m` solves the Helmholtz equation on a domain exterior to a polygon $P$ for small or medium wavenumbers $k > 0$ with inhomogenous boundary data, provided by $g$.
That is, the solver approximates $u$ as to satisfy the following

$$\Delta u(z) + k^2u(z) = 0, \quad z \in \Omega$$

$$u(z) = g(z), \quad z \in P$$

### Scattering

The solver is best demonstrated by the direct scattering problem of a time-harmonic wave from a bounded, sound-soft obstacle.
This concerns the effect of an impenetrable obstacle on an incident wave and considers the total field as a sum of incident and scattered fields, $u^{\text{t}} = u^{\text{i}} + u^{\text{s}}$.

<!-- For this problem, the total field is considered as a sum of the the incident and scatter fields, that is $u^{\text{t}} = u^{\text{i}} + u^{\text{s}}$.  -->
More specifically, for a given incident field $u^{\text{i}}$ that satisfies the Helmholtz equation, we wish to determinine a scattered field $u^{\text{s}}$ such that the total field $u^{\text{t}} = u^{\text{i}} + u^{\text{s}}$ satisfies the Helmholtz equation in the region outside of the obstacle, and vanishes at the boundary.

<!-- For a sound-soft object, Homogeneous boundary conditions  -->


This problem of solving for the scattered field $u^{\text{s}}$ can be written as an inhomogeneous boundary value problem, suitable for our solver:

<!-- 
This boils down to the following inhomogeneous boundary value problem -->

$$\Delta u^{\text{s}}(z) + k^2u^{\text{s}}(z) = 0, \quad z \in \Omega$$

$$u^{\text{s}}(z) = -u^{\text{i}}(z), \quad z \in P$$

direct, bounded obstacle, time-harmonic
A direct sound-soft scattering problem concerns determining a scattered field from the effect of an incident field on a scattering obstacle.

As mentioned, the Helmholtz equation represents the time-harmonic wave equation and so we can consider the effect of a bounded obstacle on an incident time-harmonic wave.
The total field is  -->








<!-- 
Scattering theory is concerned with the effect obstacles or inhomogeneities have on an incident waves.

The Direct Problem: This problem is concerned with determining the scattered field from the knowledge of the incident field and the scattering obstacle.

The propagation of waves in a homogeneous, isotropic medium is mathematically described by the wave equation,


Direct Scattering Problems

Scattering by a bounded obstacle

Scattering by a sound soft obstacle
The scattering problem can then be formulated as a boundary value problem for the scattered field in the region outside the scattering obstacle, consisting of

the Helmholtz equation,
a boundary condition on the boundary of the scattering obstacle,
Sommerfeld's radiation condition. -->











<!-- , a brief description for which now follows.

A function that solves the Helmholtz equation is used to sample the boundary 
The solver can handle any valid user-specified boundary sampling function and in fact the boundary data can be specified pointwise for each side of the polygon.
However, 



The function $u$ is approximated as to match the incident field $g$ and consequently make the total field vanish at the boundary.
Then the total field is represented by $f = g-u$ which has a vanishing field at the boundary by the construction of $u$ matching $g$.
By linearity of the Helmholtz equation and the fact that $g$ satisfies the Helmholtz equation, $f$ satisfies the Helmholtz equation with homogeneous boundary condition, that is
$$\Delta f(z) + k^2f(z) = 0, \quad z \in \Omega$$

$$f(z) = 0, \quad z \in P$$
 -->

Concerning the boundary sampling function, $g$, common incident fields that are inbuilt to the solver are the following

- propogating plane wave from an incident angle of propogation, $\theta$
$$g_\theta(z) = -\exp{\left(-i\text{Re}\left\[kze^{-i\theta}\right\]\right)} \quad \theta \in \[0, 2\pi)$$

- point source radiating from a point source $z_\*$
$$g_{z_\*}(z) = -H_0^{(1)}\left(k \lvert z - z_{\*} \rvert\right) \quad z_{\*} \in \Omega$$

## Usage

`U = helmholtz(wavenum, P, g)` solves the Helmholtz equation with
Dirichlet boundary data on the simply-connected region $\Omega$ bounded by `P`, which may be a polygon or circular polygon.





      
### Input arguments

#### Required positional arguments


1. `wavenum` (non-zero integer)  
    The sign of `wavnum` is used as an indicator to determine the default value for `g`.
    Negative integers are used to indicate plane wave propogation or point source radiation problem.
    The wavenumber for the problem is taken to be the absolute value of `wavnum`, a minus sign can meerly be used as a flag.
    
2. `P` (integer, vector, or string)  
   One of the following:
    - Vector of corners as complex numbers $z = x+iy$ in counterclockwise order to specify a polygon or cell array of corners `v` and pairs `[v r]` to specify a circular polygon: $r =$ radius of curvature of arc from this `v` to the next.
    - string from one of the predefined polygons in the table below.
    -  integer $\ge 3$, the number of corners of a random polygon.
    -  integer $\le -3, -1$ $\times$ no. of corners of a random circular polygon.
